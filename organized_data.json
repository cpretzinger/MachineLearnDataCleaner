When activated before each Crew iteration, all Crew data is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks and this plan will be added to each task description.Planning LLM (optional)planning_llmThe language model used by the AgentPlanner in a planning process.\nCrew Max RPM: The max_rpm attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents’ max_rpm settings if you set it.\n​Crew Output\nThe output of a crew in the CrewAI framework is encapsulated within the CrewOutput class.\nThis class provides a structured way to access results of the crew’s execution, including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models.\nThe CrewOutput includes the results from the final task output, token usage, and individual task outputs.\n​Crew Output Attributes\nAttributeParametersTypeDescriptionRawrawstrThe raw output of the crew. This is the default format for the output.PydanticpydanticOptional[BaseModel]A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the crew.JSON Dictjson_dictOptional[Dict[str, Any]]A dictionary representing the JSON output of the crew.Tasks Outputtasks_outputList[TaskOutput]A list of TaskOutput objects, each representing the output of a task in the crew.Token Usagetoken_usageDict[str, Any]A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language model’s performance during execution.\n​Crew Output Methods and Properties\nMethod/PropertyDescriptionjsonReturns the JSON string representation of the crew output if the output format is JSON.to_dictConverts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.**str**Returns the string representation of the crew output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw.\n​Accessing Crew Outputs\nOnce a crew has been executed, its output can be accessed through the output attribute of the Crew object. The CrewOutput class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.\n​Example\nCode# Example crew execution\ncrew = Crew(\nagents=[research_agent, writer_agent],\ntasks=[research_task, write_article_task],\nverbose=True\n)\n\ncrew_output = crew.kickoff()\n\n# Accessing the crew output\nprint(f\"Raw Output: {crew_output.raw}\")\nif crew_output.json_dict:\nprint(f\"JSON Output: {json.dumps(crew_output.json_dict, indent=2)}\")\nif crew_output.pydantic:\nprint(f\"Pydantic Output: {crew_output.pydantic}\")\nprint(f\"Tasks Output: {crew_output.tasks_output}\")\nprint(f\"Token Usage: {crew_output.token_usage}\")\n\n​Memory Utilization\nCrews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time. This feature allows crews to store and recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and task execution strategies.\n​Cache Utilization\nCaches can be employed to store the results of tools’ execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.\n​Crew Usage Metrics\nAfter the crew execution, you can access the usage_metrics attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.\nCode# Access the crew's usage metrics\ncrew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])\ncrew.kickoff()\nprint(crew.usage_metrics)\n\n​Crew Execution Process\n\nSequential Process: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.\nHierarchical Process: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. Note: A manager_llm or manager_agent is required for this process and it’s essential for validating the process flow.\n\n​Kicking Off a Crew\nOnce your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the kickoff() method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.\nCode# Start the crew's task execution\nresult = my_crew.kickoff()\nprint(result)\n\n​Different Ways to Kick Off a Crew\nOnce your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff method. CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process: kickoff(), kickoff_for_each(), kickoff_async(), and kickoff_for_each_async().\n\nkickoff(): Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.\nkickoff_for_each(): Executes tasks for each agent individually.\nkickoff_async(): Initiates the workflow asynchronously.\nkickoff_for_each_async(): Executes tasks for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.\n\nCode# Start the crew's task execution\nresult = my_crew.kickoff()\nprint(result)\n\n# Example of using kickoff_for_each\ninputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]\nresults = my_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)\nfor result in results:\nprint(result)\n\n# Example of using kickoff_async\ninputs = {'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}\nasync_result = my_crew.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)\nprint(async_result)\n\n# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async\ninputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]\nasync_results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)\nfor async_result in async_results:\nprint(async_result)\n\nThese methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute tasks within your crew, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to your needs.\n​Replaying from a Specific Task\nYou can now replay from a specific task using our CLI command replay.\nThe replay feature in CrewAI allows you to replay from a specific task using the command-line interface (CLI). By running the command crewai replay -t <task_id>, you can specify the task_id for the replay process.\nKickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned task outputs locally for you to be able to replay from.\n​Replaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI\nTo use the replay feature, follow these steps:\n\nOpen your terminal or command prompt.\nNavigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.\nRun the following command:\n\nTo view the latest kickoff task IDs, use:\ncrewai log-tasks-outputs\n\nThen, to replay from a specific task, use:\ncrewai replay -t <task_id>\n\nThese commands let you replay from your latest kickoff tasks, still retaining context from previously executed tasks.Was this page helpful?YesNoTasksFlowswebsitexgithublinkedinyoutubePowered by MintlifyOn this pageWhat is a Crew?Crew AttributesCrew OutputCrew Output AttributesCrew Output Methods and PropertiesAccessing Crew OutputsExampleMemory UtilizationCache UtilizationCrew Usage MetricsCrew Execution ProcessKicking Off a CrewDifferent Ways to Kick Off a CrewReplaying from a Specific TaskReplaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI"

This systematic workflow enhances project outcomes by ensuring tasks are handled with optimal efficiency and accuracy. The hierarchical process is designed to leverage advanced models like GPT-4, optimizing token usage while handling complex tasks with greater efficiency. By default, tasks in CrewAI are managed through a sequential process. However, adopting a hierarchical approach allows for a clear hierarchy in task management, where a ‘manager’ agent coordinates the workflow, delegates tasks, and validates outcomes for streamlined and effective execution. This manager agent can now be either automatically created by CrewAI or explicitly set by the user."

This feature is especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require more details to complete a task effectively. To integrate human input into agent execution, set the human_input flag in the task definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering its final answer. This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or validate the agent’s output. ​Example:"
